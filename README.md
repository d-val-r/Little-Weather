# Simple Android Weather App

## Build
Built with Kotlin using Android Studio. Uses the Open Weather Map API to both geocode location names to coordinates and then query the weather data by those coordinates.

# To-Do
- Further style UI
- Add weather images
- Shrink entries when city/state/country name is long
- Add options to show temperature in different standards
- Refactor adding weather -> display toast and do not return to home screen
